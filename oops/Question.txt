Q1: Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating 
a class named 'Area' having two methods. First method named as 'setDim' takes 
length and breadth of rectangle as parameters and the second method named as
 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle. 
Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.



Q2:Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and print the final salary.
0.constructor => empty, constructor(salary, hours)
1 - 'getInfo()' which prints the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee
2 - 'AddSal()' which adds $10 to salary of the employee if it is less than $500.
3 - 'AddWork()' which adds $5 to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.



Q3: Suppose you have a class called shape 
Shape will have some methods such as getArea and getParam. So override these two functions
in the child classes.
then there are classes called circle, square and rectangle that inherit the class shape 
//all classes should getters setters
Circle class will have raidius property and one default constructor and param constructor
Squara class will have length property and one def and para constructor
REctangle class will have length width and one def and para constructor

Test Case 
=> Circle c= new Circle()//5 should be initialized to radius if def cons is used 
   Circle c= new Circle(23);

=> Square s = new Square()//5
   Square s= new Square(2432);

=>Rectangle r= new Rectangle()// 5 5
  Rectangle r= new Rectangle(23,34)
